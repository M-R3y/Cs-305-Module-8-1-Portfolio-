Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

  Artemis Financial was a financial services provided which wanted assistance setting up secure methods of handing sensitive customer financial data. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

  Discovering and noting down all the known CVEs was something which I felt proud of. Correctly documenting these issues and finding potential fixes continuously help customers stay protected.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  One big surprise was the amount of known CVEs which needed documentation, but in the end I realized these exist because developers are actively discovering and correcting them. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  I kept the code straightforward and achieved strong logic without adding any more CVEs, other than the ones which already existed. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  Running the dependency check tool allowed me to confirm no new vulnerabilities were added. Only core logic was introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  The dependency check tool is a vital tool which is excellent to test my future assignments as they grow in complexity. Alongside useful code coverage testing tools. Like JUnit testing

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  This assignment showed me the advantage of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment. Using clear documentation allows me as a developer to implement secure coding practices and be aware of the potential issues with my communications logic.
